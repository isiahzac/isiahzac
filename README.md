## Stats

  <summary><h2>Isiah's journey</h2></summary>
  My journey in the world of technology has been a fascinating combination of experiences and learning.

  A few years ago, while enjoying my time in Iceland, I had my first introduction to the world of programming thanks to someone I met. From that moment on, I was intrigued by what programming was all about    and the exciting things that could be created with that skill.

  Eventually, I met someone else who was really into programming and I got to see firsthand how amazing programming is and all the cool things you can do. That led me to decide what I wanted to do next.

  In 2023, I decided that I had to make a career change and threw myself into studying programming while working as a bartender. During this time, I completed courses in web layout and full stack 
  development, which gave me a good foundation to get started in the world of web development.

  Currently, I'm immersed in a cybersecurity course and also expanding my knowledge with another frontend course to improve my skills and be able to express my creativity the way I like.
